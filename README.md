# Checkers in C

## How to Use:
In the root project directory, run checkers-release.lnk, which is a shortcut to an executable located at /checkers/x64/release/checkers.exe

## About This Project:
This is my second project in the C programming language. I decided to create a checkers console application with basic functionality for two players to play on a single computer. There is no computer-controlled player, the only way to play the game is by controlling each side seperately using keyboard commands. 

This is a very basic project, but I had only been working with C for two weeks when I created this.
